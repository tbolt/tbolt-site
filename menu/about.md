Welcome to my weblog. Here you will find various links, quotes, and short writings on topics I find interesting. Mostly technology.

I'm a UI Designer by trade. I try to make using software less painful.

I also build websites using [Hypertext Markup Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) (HTML), [Cascading Style Sheets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets) (CSS), and the [JavaScript Programming Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript). For a look at some of my work, checkout [Bit & Pixel](http://bitandpixel.co).
