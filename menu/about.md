Welcome to my weblog. Here you will find various links, quotes, and short writings on topics I find interesting, which is mostly technology.

I am a User Interface Designer by trade, often building websites using [Hypertext Markup Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) (HTML), [Cascading Style Sheets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets) (CSS), and the [JavaScript Programming Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript).
