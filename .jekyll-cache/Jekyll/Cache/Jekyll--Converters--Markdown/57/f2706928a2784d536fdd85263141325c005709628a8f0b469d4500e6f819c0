  <p>Itâ€™s an immovable law of design physicsâ€Šâ€”â€Šadding functionality adds complexity. You canâ€™t get around it. All you can do is try to add functionality that people really want, and do it carefully enough that the increased complexity is worth it. There are no shortcuts or magic bullets.</p>
