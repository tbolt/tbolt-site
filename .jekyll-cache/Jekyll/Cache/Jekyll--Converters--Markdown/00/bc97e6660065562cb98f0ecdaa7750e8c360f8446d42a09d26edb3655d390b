  <p><span style="line-height: normal; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">The key change in all of this, I think, is that Google has gone from a world of almost perfect clarity â€“ a text search box, a web-link index, a middle-class familyâ€™s home â€“Â to one of perfect complexity â€“ every possible kind of user, device, access and data type. Itâ€™s gone from a firehose to a rain storm. But on the other hand, no-one knows water like Google. No-one else has the same lead in building understanding of how to deal with this. Hence, I think, one should think of every app, service, drive and platform from Google notÂ so much as channels that might conflict but as varying end-points to a unified underlying strategy, which one might characterize as â€˜know a lot about how to know a lotâ€™.Â </span></p>
