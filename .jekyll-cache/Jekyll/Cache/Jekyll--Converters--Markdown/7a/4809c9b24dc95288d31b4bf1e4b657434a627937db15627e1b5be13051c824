    <h1>Btrue</h1>
    <p>Note: Btrue is an alias name</p>
    <p>Btrue provides doctors and their patients leading-edge healing treatments with their innovative biomedical technology. Their sales team was looking for an easier way to engage with doctors, so an iPad App was created to manage the end-to-end relationship from lead to order.</p>

        <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <p>This project began in 2013, which was only a few years after the iPad was released. This provided a fresh canvas for new interaction patterns and designs, but a bit challenging since there were not many conventions.</p>
        <p>Some of the project goals were fairly ambitious, such as a digital signature input, full CRM with scheduling, and inventory management.</p>

    <h2>Design Process</h2>
    <p>Given a tight timeline I started with discovery. Through discussions with the stakeholders I was able to sketch out ideas and concepts of key components of the app.</p>
    <p>The sketches provided a helpful starting point and upon gaining buy-in I quickly moved on to low-fidelity wireframes.</p>

    <h2>Mockups</h2>
    <p>While the wireframes provided a solid foundation and mapped out the IA, the overall "feel" of the app was missing. To help develop a better picture of how the app would look, I developed a high-fidelity mockup (shown at very top of page) of the sales-entry page.</p>

    <h2>Implementation</h2>
    <p>To help speed up development, I took on some of the front-end UI work where I developed view templates for app.</p>
