<blockquote>
  <p>Structuring websites is painful because thinking is painful. It is less painful to just rely on a technique. It is less painful to blame the client, the method, or the organization. You can wail about this and make snarky comments as much as you want, but no technique or technology is going to solve a lack of thought. On the contrary! Adding stronger, faster, more technology is going to amplify our thoughtlessness. And thatâ€™s why the plastic soup of data weâ€™re fouling our online oceans with is not making us any better at solving tangible problems.</p>
