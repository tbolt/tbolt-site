I"~<p>Great post by <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/14562">Jeremy Keith on Prototyping</a>, I particularly like this bit:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Build prototypes to test ideas, designs, interactions, and interfaces …and then throw the code away. The value of a prototype is in answering questions and testing hypotheses. Don’t fall for the sunk cost fallacy when it’s time to switch over into production mode.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m a huge proponent of prototyping for all the reasons mentioned, but anytime a prototype morphs into the final product, it causes more headache than if we were to shelve it and start fresh.</p>
