I"p<p>Territory Studio created hundreds of screen graphics for the motion picture The Martian and <a href="http://www.territorystudio.com/work/motion/?p=Martian">they’re great:</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As a story that is mediated by technology, hundreds of screens are employed across eight key sets, forming the lens through which the drama unfolds.</p>

  <p>Working closely with NASA, Territory developed a series of deft and elegant concepts that combine factual integrity and filmic narrative, yet are forward looking and pushing NASA’s current UI conventions as much as possible.</p>

<p>Awesome.</p>
