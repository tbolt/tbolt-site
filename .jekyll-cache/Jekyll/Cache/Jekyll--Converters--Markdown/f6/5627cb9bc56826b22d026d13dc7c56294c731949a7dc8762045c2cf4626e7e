I"W<p>I love good app icons. <a href="https://tbolt.space/2017/09/28/on-app-icons">Others do too</a>. They often reflect the quality of the software they represent. On MacOS, some of the best icons come from indie software developers. Whereas large companies frequently field uninspiring, flat, and dull icons. For example, compare an early version of the <a href="https://codefresh.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/image1-1.png">Docker for Mac Icon</a> to the <a href="https://postgresapp.com">Postgres.app Icon</a>. I dread launching Docker for Mac not least because of itâ€™s low-quality app icon.</p>
