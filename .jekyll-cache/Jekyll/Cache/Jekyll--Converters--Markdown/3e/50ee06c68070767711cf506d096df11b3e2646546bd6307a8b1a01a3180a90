I":<p>Have you ever lost or had your credit card stolen? It’s a common thing and usually a pain to recover from. Imagine if, when you lose your credit card, you could just temporarily block purchases from your iPhone/Android.</p>

<p>Today, Simple announced a few new features including the ability to block (and unblock) your Simple credit card from your mobile device.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After blocking your card, any additional card transactions will be declined. If you find that there’s no reason to be concerned about your card’s security, tap “Open Card,” and you’re free to use your card again.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is quite awesome.</p>

<p>Now, I have a Simple card and the app but I have yet to “switch” it to be my primary bank (I say “switch” because there is a zero balance and no money is being deposited regularly). However, I do intend give it a try at some point.</p>

<p>What’s great about this is I bet more banks will notice and try to implement the same thing.</p>
