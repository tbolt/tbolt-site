<blockquote>
  <p>As far as I know, Iâ€™m the first person to have tried DIY-ing plastic aligners. Theyâ€™re much more comfortable than braces, and fit my teeth quite well. I was pleased to find, when I put the first one on, that it only seemed to put any noticeable pressure on the teeth that I planned to move- a success! Iâ€™ve been wearing them all day and all night for 16 weeks, only taking them out to eat. Iâ€™m planning on fabricating a bunch of retainers for the current position, which I can use â€“ till I die â€“ at night. They also happen to work very well as perfectly fitting whitening trays, when trimmed down a tiny bit. Theyâ€™re also fantastic night guards- theyâ€™ve been protecting my teeth from nighttime grinding, without being bulky.</p>

  <p>And, most importantly, I feel like I can freely smile again. Thatâ€™s whatâ€™s most important.</p>

<p>Impressive.</p>
