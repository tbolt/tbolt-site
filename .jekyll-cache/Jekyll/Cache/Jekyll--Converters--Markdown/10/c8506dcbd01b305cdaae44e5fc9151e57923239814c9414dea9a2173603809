I"á<p>The Aeropress coffee maker makes a great cup of coffee, and making it is a nice experience but nice != great. You don‚Äôt <em>settle</em> for a nice cup of coffee so the experience making it should be as good as the result. <strong>My idea is simple: A station to elegantly hold all of the pieces of the Aeropress.</strong> Just a butchers block of wood with cut outs for each individual part. I don‚Äôt have a good diagram, but it‚Äôs not hard to visualize how <a href="/uploads/2013/06/aero_block.png">this</a> would look with different cuts on both the front and top for each component.</p>

<p>It seems so very obvious to me when im making coffee via the Aeropress that there needs to be something like this created. So im releasing my idea to the wild. If there is enough interest, I may try to develop a prototype and head to Kickstarter. Alternatively, I would we willing to work with someone who has the wherwithal to make this happen. I have a pretty good idea of exactly how the block would need to be cut to accommodate for each component.</p>

<p>Trying to use inventor fusion, I created the mock-up below but it doesn‚Äôt really come across exactly how I want it to. As well, this would be something I would research more to see how folks are actually using them. I know how I use mine and I will keep the two primary tubes together after a ‚Äúpress,‚Äù but I don‚Äôt expect this in every case. So it would require some more development to find the ‚Äújust right‚Äù layout.</p>
