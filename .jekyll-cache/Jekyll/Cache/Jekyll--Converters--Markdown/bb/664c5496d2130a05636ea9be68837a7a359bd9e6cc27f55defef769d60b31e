  <p>Simplicity is great, as iOS has shown. But thereâ€™s a difference between conceptual simplicity and visual simplicity. Just hiding controls does make things appear simpler, but it doesnâ€™t actually make them any simpler. The complexity is now just hidden. Similarly, removing features that few people use is a good idea, but like any good idea, it can be taken too far. At a certain point, youâ€™re just making your application worse for everyone, even new users.</p>
