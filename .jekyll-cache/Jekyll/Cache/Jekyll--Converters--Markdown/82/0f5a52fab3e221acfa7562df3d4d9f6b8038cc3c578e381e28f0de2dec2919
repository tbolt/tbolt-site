  <p>There are two stories here. The first is a story about a vision of the webâ€™s future that never quite came to fruition.

<p>I still use RSS everyday. Itâ€™s my preferred way of reading news. <a href="https://feedbin.com">Feedbin</a> for syncing and managing feeds, <a href="http://www.reederapp.com/ios/">Reeder</a> for iOS, and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/readkit/id588726889">Readkit</a> for MacOS.</p>
