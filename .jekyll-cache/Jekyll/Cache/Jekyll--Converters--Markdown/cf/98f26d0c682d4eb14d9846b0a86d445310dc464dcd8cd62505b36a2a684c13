I"j<p>Google yesterday announced <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2015/05/picture-this-fresh-approach-to-photos.html">Google Photos</a> which, among other things, has an extremely impressive search feature:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>…with a simple search you can instantly find any photo—whether it’s your dog, your daughter’s birthday party, or your favorite beach in Santa Barbara.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have only used it for a few minutes but I can already tell how incredibly useful this will be. Seems so obvious but I think this is the true way forward for photo management. Google at its finest.</p>
