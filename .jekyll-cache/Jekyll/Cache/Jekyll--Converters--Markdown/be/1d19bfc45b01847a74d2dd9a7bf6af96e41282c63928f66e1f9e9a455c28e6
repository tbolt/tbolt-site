I"Ê<p>Big news today, Yahoo is partnering with Dropbox to do file attachments. Especially interesting considering Dropbox just purchased Gmail client app Mailbox. Iâ€™m going to stamp this as a Marissa Mayer move.</p>

<p>Techcrunch:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In case youâ€™ve forgotten, Yahoo! Mail is still the No. 3 most-used mail service in the world behind Hotmail and Gmail. But the last time we checked, it was No. 1 in the United States.</p>
