I"<p>One item I have been very intrigued by lately is the Apple Thunderbolt Display. Why? It’s a strange item that is so niche I wonder how it exists. However, I believe it to be a compelling product. Not only is it a gorgeous 27″ IPS display with excellent color accuracy, it also <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/2011/09/thunderbolt-display-packs-almost-enough-hardware-to-be-an-imac/">packs a number of hardware controllers.</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>The ultimate docking station.</strong></p>

  <p>With just one cable, connect any Thunderbolt-enabled Mac and get 27 inches of high-resolution screen space, high-quality audio, a FaceTime HD camera, FireWire 800 and Gigabit Ethernet ports — and a Thunderbolt port you can use to daisy-chain additional high-performance peripherals such as hard drives and video capture devices.</p>

<p>With the recent updates to the iMac, I can’t help but crave an update to the Thunderbolt display.</p>

<p>Not too often do you see a dock combined with a display. It’s a neat concept that really makes sense, and arguably the most elegant solution for laptop docking. The thin-and-light to-go machine and large home dock-in-a-display that simply extends your experience.</p>

<p>Let’s see an update for the Apple Thunderbolt Display with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An ultrathin design similar to the Late-2012 iMacs</li>
  <li>Screen-on-glass</li>
  <li>A 75% Less reflective display</li>
  <li>Optional Fusion Drive</li>
  <li>A Couple USB 3.0 ports</li>
</ul>

<p>I also wonder if we will see more integration with iDevices, like being able to hook up an iPad to a Thunderbolt Display would be quite interesting. Plus, following with the hardware-in-a-display model, we could see more benefits of pairing the Thunderbolt display with an iPad.</p>
