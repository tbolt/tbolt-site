I"ó<p>Great Article by <a href="https://ia.net/">iA</a> <a href="https://ia.net/know-how/on-icons">on icons</a> and their widespread use and misuse. Loved this quote in particular:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Design is not a natural science. It‚Äôs a practice that benefits from science and measurement, yet the full quality of a design cannot be objectively assessed in theory. User tests and analytics do not replace your designers, but verify their assumptions. There is more in a product than the designer can premeditate and there is more in a design than we can measure. This ‚Äúmore‚Äù can only be reached when we talk to humans working with it.</p>
