I"!<p>Great excerpt from a <a href="http://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/652580/ddb64b1eb568fe87/">LWN.com article</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Krekel quoted former Facebook researcher Jeff Hammerbacher, who said: “The best minds of my generation are thinking about how to make people click ads. That Sucks.” Instead of spending time on “getting us into space, flying cars, or whatever”, the best minds in IT are focused on how to get people to click more ads.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Web advertising has become invasive and hostile regardless of the platform. The advertising-driven business models have put reputable sites in a bad position, they either make less money or provide a better experience. This plus the above note make me think that this topic isn’t getting the attention it deserves.</p>
