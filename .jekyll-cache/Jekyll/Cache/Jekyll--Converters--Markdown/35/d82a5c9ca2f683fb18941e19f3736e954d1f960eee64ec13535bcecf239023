    <h1>certify.SBA.gov</h1>
    <p>The Small Business Administration's certify.SBA.gov is a digital platform that enables small business owners an easy way to apply for contracting-assistance and business development programs. Many of the SBAs programs use older software or paper for applications. This makes it difficult and time-consuming for both citizens and the SBA to process and maintain. This project aimed to modernize the end-to-end process with a focus on scalable infrastructure and human-centered design.</p>
