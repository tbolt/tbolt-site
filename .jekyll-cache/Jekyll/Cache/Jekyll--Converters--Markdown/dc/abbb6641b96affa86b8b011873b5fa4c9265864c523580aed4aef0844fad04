I"<p>Occasionally I find myself down rabbit holes exploring the history of computing. Donald Knuth is often a name that comes up as his magnum opus <a href="https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/taocp.html">The Art of Computer Programming</a> is well known and revered in computer science and programmer circles. One such exploration led me to <a href="https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/things.html">his talks on God and Computer Science</a>. I havenâ€™t listened yet, but I plan to as I find it a curious topic. I also enjoyed these <a href="https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/mit-lectures.html">lecture titles</a>:</p>

  <p>Why the lectures might be interesting anyway.</p>
