I"ı<p>Remarkably thin.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs the impression the first glance gave me. It‚Äôs quite an engineering achievement, and further strengthens the argument that this is the future of desktop computers.</p>

<p>Now this new slim design doesn‚Äôt come without sacrifice. iFixits teardown shows just how difficult it will be to do any sort of upgrades or repairs. While a batch of nerds will be upset with this, it‚Äôs clearly the right move. Apple sells a clean and complete desktop. If you need hot-swap hd bays, or easily removable RAM, look elsewhere. Id wager 90%+ of iMac owners never even consider upgrading even the RAM.</p>

<p>Concerning the ‚Äúupdated‚Äù display. It‚Äôs nice, a good upgrade but not jaw-dropping. About what you expect since its not retina. Apple claims 75% reduction in glare, which, I had a hard time distinguishing that this was true. But going back and forth from a Thunderbolt Display, the difference is clear. It‚Äôs a very nice improvement but still not on the level of matte.</p>
