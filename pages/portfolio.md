<h1>Solutions Analyst at T. Rowe Price</h1>
<p>I joined <a href="https://troweprice.com">T. Rowe Price</a>'s Emerging Solutions group in 2010. While there I researched a variety of emerging technologies including WebRTC, Social Business Solutions, Collaboration Tools, Cryptocurrencies, Gamification. I also helped champion user adoption of tools such as <a href="https://www.jivesoftware.com">Jive Software</a>, <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/roambi.html">Roambi</a>, <a href="https://www.brightidea.com">BrightIdea</a>, and <a href="https://plaid.com">Plaid</a>. <!-- Working as a designer with a team of developers I would often collaborate on building UIs for prototypes to demonstrate to the business. -->
