    <h1>Bit & Pixel</h1>
    <p>I started Bit & Pixel as a company to work with start-ups and local businesses.</p>

        <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <p>Coming up with a name that would reflect the aims of the company was difficult. I landed on "Bit & Pixel" as they are some of the atomic pieces of computer systems. Pixel's materialize into graphical user-interfaces, and bit's are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit">"basic units of information used in computing and digital communications."</a></p>
        <p>Aside from the name, coming up with all the necessary bits to a brand is simply time-consuming.</p>
