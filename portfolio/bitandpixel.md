    <h1>Bit & Pixel</h1>
    <p>In 2012 I started my own freelance company to work with start-ups and local businesses. While I have since focused more on full-time engagements, I still like to keep it around for smaller ad-hoc engagements.</p>

        <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <p>Coming up with a name that would reflect the aims of the company was difficult. I landed on "Bit & Pixel" as they are some of the atomic pieces of computer systems. Pixel's materialize into graphical user-interfaces, and bit's are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit">"basic units of information used in computing and digital communications."</a></p>
        <p>Aside from the name, coming up with all the necessary bits to a brand is simply time-consuming. Managing to do this on the side can be tough.</p>
