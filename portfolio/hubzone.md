    <h1>HUBZone Map</h1>
    <p>The Historically Underutilized Business Zones (HUBZone) program, offered by the Small Business Administration, helps small businesses in low-income areas gain access to federal contracting opportunities. A companyâ€™s HUBZone certification is dependent on several key factors mostly concerning where a company and it's employees are located. The HUBZone Map provides an easy way to determine if your home or office are in qualified zones.</p>

        <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <p>The expectations for mapping applications are extremely high given consumer products such as Google Maps. Creating an experience for HUBZone participants and potential participants, we wanted to match these expectations.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, through user research and testing we were able to arrive at an experience that was easy and effective to use.</p>
