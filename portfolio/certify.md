    <h1>certify.SBA.gov</h1>
    <p>The Small Business Administration's certify.SBA.gov is a digital platform that enables small business owners and easy way to apply for contracting-assistance programs. Many of these programs use older software or paper for applications. This makes it difficult and time-consuming for both citizens and the SBA to process and maintain. We we're tasked with modernizing the end-to-end process.</p>

        <p>Federal regulations behind these programs can be difficult to work with, and can implicitly dictate parts of the experience.</p>
        <p>Note: This project is currently in active development as of January 2018.</p>
