    <h1>T. Rowe Price</h1>
    <p>I joined <a href="https://troweprice.com">T. Rowe Price</a>'s Emerging Solutions group in 2010. While there I researched a variety of emerging technologies including WebRTC, Social Business Solutions, Collaboration Tools, Cryptocurrencies, Gamification. I also helped champion user adoption of tools such as <a href="https://www.jivesoftware.com">Jive Software</a>, <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/roambi.html">Roambi</a>, <a href="https://www.brightidea.com">BrightIdea</a>, and <a href="https://plaid.com">Plaid</a>.</p>

        <h3>Solutions Analyst</h3>
        <p>As a Solutions Analyst in a mostly technology-focused group, I was responsible for exploring emerging technologies and partnering with business units to deliver solutions. Often these solutions were proof-of-concept or simply prototypes. This helped communicate new technologies and market-test without a huge up-front investment.</p>
