    <h1>Tourbook</h1>
    <p>Tourbook is an app to help you track and log concerts you attend. For frequent concert-goers, remembering the details of past concerts can be tough. "Where did we see them?" "What did they play?" are questions that often spring up and it can be hard to recall long after. Tourbook makes it simple to log and organize all of the concerts you attend over a lifetime.</p>

        <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <p>When I started this project I was curious about using React Native, so that's what I used. React Native is nice, but I found keeping up with the release cycle to be tough early on.</p>
        <p>Doing both the design and development is fun and provides a lot of autonomy but is limiting given lack of time.</p>
        <p>Coming up with a business model for something this niche can be tough. Since it's more of a passion/learning project, I landed on giving it away free and having a tip jar.</p>

    <h2>Current Status</h2>
    <p>When I started the project in 2015 I wanted to keep it focused on some core concepts and get it out the door as quick as possible. As with many side projects though, I got side-tracked and have yet to complete development. I would like to pick it up soon, but there are a few other prorities at the moment, so don't count on it any time soon.</p>
    <p>The project is now open source and available on <a href="https://github.com/tbolt/tourbook-app">github</a>. If you are interested in picking it up, let me know, or just PR/fork it. üëç </p>
