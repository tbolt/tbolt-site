> “Too bad the Truth in Lending Act does not apply to legislation. If so, this legislation never would have made it out of committee. Not only is the Patriot Act one of the most unpatriotic pieces of legislation ever passed, it’s also one of the most costly to comply with, costing the financial industry over a billion dollars a year. It costs my small firm alone hundreds of thousands of dollars per year and now acts as the greatest barrier to entry in the brokerage industry. Had this act been in place when I launched my brokerage firm, I would have lacked the financial resources to start it up. My total compliance cost since these anti-money laundering rules went into effect in 2003 has been well in excess of 1 million dollars. Yet despite this great expense, I have yet to uncover a single act of money laundering, or identified a single terrorist among my clients.”
