I love good app icons. I've linked to others that feel the same like the [Pixelmator developers](https://tbolt.space/2017/09/28/on-app-icons).

* Often big names and/or budgets produce hideous icons
* Nord obviously cares about their UI of their keyboards
* The App icon is truly delightful and completely unsuspecting
