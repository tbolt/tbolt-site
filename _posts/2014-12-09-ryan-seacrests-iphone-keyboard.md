[re/code:](http://recode.net/2014/12/08/typo-ships-new-iphone-6-keyboard-plans-ipad-product-for-next-year/)

> Typo, the Ryan Seacrest-backed iPhone keyboard, has returned with an iPhone 6 keyboard it says is designed to avoid incurring the legal challenges that forced the company’s [first product](http://recode.net/video/typo-keyboard-case-review/) off the market.

> Although **the keyboard blocks the iPhone’s Touch ID feature**, Hallier said that the Typo’s core base would rather have the fingerprint sensor blocked and be able to more easily tap out messages.

Good idea, no one uses Touch Id anyway. Oh wait&#8230;
