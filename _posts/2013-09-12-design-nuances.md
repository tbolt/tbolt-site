Something I consider myself fluent at is being able to look at an array of interfaces and pick up on subtle nuances amongst design decisions, trends, and practices. When you are always conscious of the interface, it quickly becomes apparent how the designers are influenced by a.) specific other designs b.) industry practices and c.) personal taste.

Recently I have been studying iOS7 from a purely speculative approach. And instead of just looking at screenshots and dismissing the brightly colored app-icons, or mocking some of the animations or effects, I like to enjoy the work that has been put into it. Which is something I would recommend to anyone involved in both design and development. That is to take it in first, really digest it before _reacting_. Use it a more-than-healthy amount.

A common thought i&#8217;ve read on iOS7 is that it brings together many great things from Android, Windows Phone, and even WebOS. I would argue that as a generalization it goes much deeper than that. The designers at Apple are studying day in and day out what works, and what doesn&#8217;t work. Looking at the work of many folks, both inside and outside the firm. Influence runs deep.

As a neat anecdote of this, take a look at the gradient in iA Writer&#8217;s cursor and then look at the app gradient-background on the App Store icon. I didn&#8217;t do any actual color comparison in photoshop but it&#8217;s fairly easy to see the similarities. This may be a bit of a stretch and likely just a coincidence but interesting nonetheless. iA Writer has been available since 2011 and hasn&#8217;t changed a bit other than adding new features, yet iA Writer looks like it was born on iOS7.
