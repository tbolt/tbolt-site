Valuewalk:

> Zynga Inc (NASDAQ:ZNGA), according to news released today,Â will no longer receive special treatment on Facebook

Excellent move by Facebook. Zynga is a garbage company. Not only do they make trash games, they also  [blatantly rip other games as well](http://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2012/01/25/everything-wrong-with-zynga-in-one-image/).

Granted Zynga is a big part of Facebooks revenue, I still think this was a good move for them.

Facebook is a strong company, and I am with [MG Seigler](http://parislemon.com/post/30894199204/time-to-freak-out-then-calm-down-about-the-facebook-ipo) that even though the FB IPO was a flop, they&#8217;re still a good company. I also bought facebook once it dropped below 20.
