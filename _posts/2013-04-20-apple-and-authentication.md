If Apple integrates biometric authentication into the next iPhone, I think it will kickstart the next generation of consumer authentication. One where passwords slowly start becoming a historical item. **Authentication 2.0
  
** Because thinking beyond just fingerprint scanning to unlock your device, it&#8217;s easy to see how you could use it to login to any website. 

Digital security is tough though, so there are certainly some holes with this.
